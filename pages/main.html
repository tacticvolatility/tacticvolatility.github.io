<h1>Celia Tool</h1>

<h3>Project Abstract</h3>
<p>

Tactics are used by self-adaptive systems to respond to changes and accomplish defined objectives. Example tactics include the provisioning of an additional virtual machine in a web farm when the workload reaches a specific threshold, or reducing non-essential functionality on an autonomous UAV when battery levels are low. Tactic volatility is encountered variability in the cost, latency or reliability attributes of a tactic. Previous work has stated the need for a simulation tool and dataset to support research in creating sufficiently tactic volatility aware systems. To address this stated need, we have created CELIA(taCtic EvaLuator sImulAtor). This publicly available tool emulates a configurable hypothetical intelligent Cyber-Physical System (CPS). This highly configurable tool enables researchers to easily evaluate their own learning-based adaptation strategies via various metrics including achieved vs. expected utility, correct adaptation decisions and achieved system success. The data created by our CELIA tool will support the evaluation of other tactic volatility aware processes by providing tactic volatility data.
