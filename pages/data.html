            <b>CELIA</b> is a utility measuring tool. It simulates a drone requesting updates from it's base station. It predicts the utility of performing the update in terms of cost and latency. If the utility is higher than a certain threshold, set according to a service level agreement, the drone updates itself. When the system updates, it is given a reward (difference between the actual utility and the threshold). This way, the system is penalized if the actual utility is less than the threshold. If the system doesn't perform an update when it was supposed to according to the actual utility, it is assigned 'lost utility' (which equal to the real utility of updating). All data is output to .csv files to support easy analysis of the incorporated tactic volatility aware process.
