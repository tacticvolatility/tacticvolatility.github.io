<h1>Tool Download</h1>


<p>There are several ways which you may download our tool for use. These include:

<ol>
	<li><b><!--<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/g.rit.edu/folderview?id=0B07wmFreS34FMEN4QUJOSUtESXM&usp=sharing#" target="_blank">-->

<!-- https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2pV6O4YmVisRk0xM2thamtoa00-->


	<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByZZgsYRIrAVQ3JVZnZFbklDUmM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">VM Download:</a> </b>This is probably the most straightforward solution. We've created a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS VM which may be opened using <a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads" target="_blank">VMWare</a> Virtual Machine Manager. All source code, and required components are already installed in this VM. While using the VM, the root password is "android1234", however you should not be need it for any of the tasks associated with using M-Perm.</li>
	<br />
	<li><b><a href="https://github.com/MPerm/MPermission" target="_blank">Source Code Download:</a> </b>We have made all M-Perm source code publicly available to users, and have tested the application on both Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and OSX 10.9. Although we have provided installation and usage instructions, the user should take extra care to ensure that all necessary 3rd party components have been properly installed for their specific operating system. M-Perm is primarily Python based, and has been tested on Python version 3.4.3, although any Python version 3.0+ should be sufficient.</li>
