This is the source code for 'CELIA', a tool that nominally emulates a configurable hypothetical Cyber-PhysicalSystem (CPS) that is tasked with autonomously performing operations such as i/o tasks and computational tasks, while making decisions in accordance with its configurable Service Level Agreement (SLA). The objective of CELIA is to not mimic any specific system,but to provide a reasonably general simulation tool and dataset to benefit a diverse range of autonomous processes and evaluations. CELIA evaluates provided prediction techniques by providing evaluations including achieved vs. predicted utility, number of correct vs. incorrect adaption decisions and achieved system goals. The predictions made using the provided or user supplied machine learning components and data can be easily evaluated against the ground truth to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning techniques.
